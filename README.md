okay so the file name says lspdfr ready
https://www.lcpdfr.com/lspdfr/index/?ysclid=mle0zmf3kh799886106
this is what lspdfr is, its a gta 5 framework on which u can work as a cop
on singleplayer

the file i have uploaded has folders with clothing and the correct names and such to make it work

i did this a while back, it took me one nights work to rename everything but this either works for lspdfr somehow or on fivem
